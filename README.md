# perftools.rbx (work in progress)

Profiler for Rubinius. Based on [gperftools](http://gperftools.googlecode.com) (former google-perftools).

## Planned advantages

### Profiling remote process

It is possible since if process is run with Rubinius::Agent enabled, agent can expose backtrace remotely.

## Inspired by

[perftools.rb](https://github.com/tmm1/perftools.rb) by [Aman Gupta a.k.a. tmm1](https://github.com/tmm1).
